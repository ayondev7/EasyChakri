# What Changed? Migration Guide

## Overview

Your backend has been transformed from a **monolithic structure** to a **microservices architecture** without breaking your frontend!

## Before vs After

### Before (Monolithic)
```
backend-v2/
├── src/
│   ├── main.ts                    ← Single entry point
│   ├── app.module.ts              ← All modules together
│   └── modules/
│       ├── auth/
│       ├── user/
│       ├── company/
│       ├── job/                   ← Everything in one place
│       ├── application/
│       ├── interview/
│       └── notification/
```

**How it worked:**
- One server on port 5000
- All modules loaded together
- Direct function calls between modules
- If one module crashes, entire server crashes

### After (Microservices)
```
backend-v2/
├── apps/                          ← NEW: Microservices
│   ├── gateway/                   ← HTTP entry point
│   │   └── src/
│   │       ├── main.ts
│   │       ├── job/               ← Gateway controllers
│   │       ├── application/
│   │       └── interview/
│   ├── job-service/               ← Separate service
│   ├── application-service/       ← Separate service
│   └── interview-service/         ← Separate service
└── src/                           ← Shared modules
    ├── common/
    │   └── constants/
    │       ├── services.ts        ← NEW: Service names
    │       └── message-patterns.ts ← NEW: RabbitMQ patterns
    └── modules/
        ├── auth/                  ← Stays in Gateway
        ├── user/                  ← Stays in Gateway
        ├── company/               ← Stays in Gateway
        └── notification/          ← Shared across services
```

**How it works now:**
- Gateway on port 5000 (HTTP)
- 3 microservices (RabbitMQ)
- Services communicate via messages
- If one service crashes, others keep running

## What Moved Where?

### Services That Stayed in Gateway
These handle HTTP directly and don't need separation:
- ✅ **Auth Module** - Login, register, authentication
- ✅ **User Module** - User profile management
- ✅ **Company Module** - Company CRUD operations
- ✅ **Socket Module** - WebSocket connections
- ✅ **Notification Module** - Shared by all services

### Services That Became Microservices
These were the largest services with complex logic:

#### 1. Job Module → Job Microservice
**Why?** Largest module with 20+ features
- Job CRUD operations
- Job search & filtering
- Job analytics (by category, location, skills)
- Saved jobs
- Job applications
- Dashboard statistics
- Trending searches

#### 2. Application Module → Application Microservice
**Why?** Heavy business logic for application tracking
- Application management
- Status updates
- Recruiter reviews
- Application statistics
- Seeker application history

#### 3. Interview Module → Interview Microservice
**Why?** Separate workflow from applications
- Interview scheduling
- Interview updates
- Interview cancellations
- Interview statistics
- Upcoming interviews

## New Files Created

## Code Changes

### Example: Creating a Job

**Before (Monolithic):**
```typescript
@Post()
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
async createJob(@CurrentUser() user: any, @Body() dto: CreateJobDto) {
  return this.jobService.createJob(user.sub, dto);
}
```

**After (Gateway Controller):**
```typescript
@Post()
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
async createJob(@CurrentUser() user: any, @Body() dto: CreateJobDto) {
  return firstValueFrom(
    this.jobServiceClient.send('create_job', { 
      recruiterId: user.sub, 
      dto 
    })
  );
}
```

**After (Microservice Controller):**
```typescript
@MessagePattern('create_job')
async createJob(@Payload() data: { recruiterId: string; dto: CreateJobDto }) {
  return this.jobService.createJob(data.recruiterId, data.dto);
}
```

### What's Different?
1. Gateway receives HTTP and converts to RabbitMQ message
2. Microservice receives RabbitMQ message and processes it
3. Service logic (JobService) remains the same!
4. Communication is asynchronous via RabbitMQ

## Frontend Impact

### Does Frontend Need Changes?

**NO!** ✅

Your frontend still makes the same HTTP requests to the same endpoints on port 5000. The Gateway handles everything internally.

### Example: Frontend Code (No Changes Needed)
```typescript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/jobs', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(jobData)
})
```

This works exactly the same as before!

## Database Impact

### Does Database Change?

**NO!** ✅

- Same Prisma schema
- Same database connection
- All services share the same database
- No migrations needed (unless you want to add new features)

## Environment Variables

### New Variables Added
```env
RABBITMQ_URL="amqp://..."           ← NEW: RabbitMQ connection
JOB_SERVICE_PORT=5001               ← NEW: (Not used, for reference)
APPLICATION_SERVICE_PORT=5002       ← NEW: (Not used, for reference)
INTERVIEW_SERVICE_PORT=5003         ← NEW: (Not used, for reference)
```

All other variables remain the same.

## Package.json Changes

### New Scripts
```json
"start:gateway": "nest start gateway --watch",
"start:job-service": "nest start job-service --watch",
"start:application-service": "nest start application-service --watch",
"start:interview-service": "nest start interview-service --watch",
"start:all": "concurrently \"npm run start:gateway\" ..."
"build:all": "nest build gateway && nest build job-service ..."
```

### New Dependencies
```json
"@nestjs/microservices": "^11.1.6",
"amqp-connection-manager": "^4.1.14",
"amqplib": "^0.10.4",
"concurrently": "^9.1.2"
```

## Benefits of Changes

### Before (Problems)
❌ Can't scale individual features
❌ One error can crash everything
❌ Hard to deploy updates
❌ All code loads even if not needed
❌ Can't work on different parts independently

### After (Solutions)
✅ Scale services independently
✅ Services isolated - one crash doesn't affect others
✅ Deploy services separately
✅ Load only what's needed
✅ Teams can work on different services
✅ Modern, production-ready architecture
✅ Industry-standard approach
✅ Easier to maintain and debug

## How to Revert (If Needed)

If you want to go back to monolithic:

1. Keep using the old `src/` structure
2. Don't run the microservices
3. Just run: `npm run dev` (old way)

Both structures exist in the codebase!

## Key Takeaways

1. **Frontend doesn't change** - Same endpoints, same port
2. **Database doesn't change** - Same Prisma schema
3. **Business logic doesn't change** - Same service code
4. **Architecture changes** - How services communicate
5. **Scalability improved** - Can scale parts independently
6. **Reliability improved** - Service isolation
7. **Modern approach** - Industry-standard microservices

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Get CloudAMQP URL
2. ✅ Update `.env` with RABBITMQ_URL
3. ✅ Run `.\start-services.ps1`
4. ✅ Test with your frontend
5. ✅ Monitor in CloudAMQP dashboard

That's it! Your backend is now a professional microservices architecture! 🚀
